# QuantumQC
Quantum computing is a field of computing that uses quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations on data. It is a rapidly growing field with potential applications in fields such as cryptography, chemistry, and optimization. Quantum computers can solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.
