Quantum computing is a field of computing that uses quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations on data. It is a rapidly growing field with potential applications in fields such as cryptography, chemistry, and optimization. Quantum computers can solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.
In this project, Quantum Image Processing is implemented with qiskit using QPIE model
